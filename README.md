# TMA4215 Numerical Mathematics - Project 1

### Project Introduction
This project was completed as part of the TMA4215 Numerical Mathematics course. It focuses on exploring numerical methods for signal and image processing, with a specific emphasis on Fourier series. The project's main goal was to gain a deeper understanding of Fourier Transforms and their practical applications in real-world scenarios such as signal and image processing.

### Project Details
**Course**: TMA4215 Numerical Mathematics
**Completion Date**: October 3, 2023

### Project Structure
The project was divided into three main tasks:

1. **The (Discrete) Fourier Transform**: This involved exploring the properties of the Fourier Transform, proving the orthonormality of certain function sets, and calculating Fourier coefficients.
2. **Signal Processing**: Here, I applied Fourier Transform concepts to process and analyze signals, using convolution and filtering techniques.
3. **Image Processing**: This task extended the Fourier Transform concepts to the realm of image processing, involving work with multivariate Fourier transforms and applying different filters to images.

### Repository Contents
* Jupyter Notebook: Contains all the code, calculations, and visualizations.
* Data Files: .csv files and images used in the project.
* Code for the different tasks.

### How to Use This Repository
1. Clone the repository or download all files to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have a Python environment with necessary libraries (e.g., numpy, matplotlib, scipy).
3. Run the Jupyter notebook, executing cells in the order they appear.

### Reflection and Learning
This project was a significant learning experience, allowing me to practically apply theoretical concepts from the field of numerical mathematics. It enhanced my understanding of complex mathematical functions and their applications in modern computational problems.
