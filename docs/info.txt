Composite integration rules. 
The word composite is often used when a numerical integration method is applied with more than one sub-interval. 
Strictly speaking then, writing, e.g., "the trapezoidal method", should imply the use of only a single trapezoid, 
while "the composite trapezoidal method" is the most correct name when several trapezoids are used. However, 
this naming convention is not always followed, 
so saying just "the trapezoidal method" may point to a single trapezoid as well as the composite rule with many trapezoids.
