Oppgave 1c): dont know how I can explain that the two spaces are equal as well as the dimension of Tn. I know that if theyre the same, dimTn=dimSn
Something to do with linear combination?

cosx = (e^(ix) + e^(-ix))/2 and sinx = (e^(ix)-e^(-ix))/2

e^(ix) = cosx + isin(x)





1e) What does that mean for the approximation in the equation above?
    We need not to find ck's with k's larger than N, since these are already contained in the interval


1g) Why does the end expression imply circulant matrix?
    I also need to derive a formula for F_N^(-1) (Can just guess)


1h) Write new explaination for which plots approximates well


1i) 
* Using Euler’s identity – Can you use the coefficients to “remove” the second
summand of f2 by just modifying fˆ ∈ C
257
- We can do this by transforming f2 and then setting the coefficients c_k and c_(-k) with k = 64 to 0, since this corresponds to the second summon. Afterwards we can invers transform.
* Can you do the same for the case N = 17, i. e. fˆ ∈ C
 - No because every element in C^17 contains part of the second summon.

17? Try to find a reason for
your answer

2b) Need to prove (\boldsymbol{a} * \boldsymbol{b})\hat{} = \hat{\boldsymbol{a}} \circ \hat{\boldsymbol{b}}. That is: Convolution in time turns into multiplication in frequency domain.


3a) Need to add proof of why O(N1N2log(N1N2)))

3b) Need to add range of value

3b) Need to add range, i.e. find np.min and np.max of array, i.e. F_values[i]



NOTATER FOR FINAL DAY


skriv inn 1g) -> hvorfor er dette circulant matrix??

skriv inn 1c) (hvordan blir rommene like?)

dobbeltsjekk 1i) angående dobbel summand

2b) 2 hvorfor  (a ∗ b)ˆ= aˆ ◦ˆb,   -> hvordan simplifiserer dette (circ a)(circ b)


3a) ) Using 1D Fourier transforms, prove that Equation (3) can be computed in the same fast
way, namely in O(N1N2 log(N1N2))
