Oppgave 1c): dont know how I can explain that the two spaces are equal as well as the dimension of Tn. I know that if theyre the same, dimTn=dimSn
Something to do with linear combination?

cosx = (e^(ix) + e^(-ix))/2 and sinx = (e^(ix)-e^(-ix))/2

e^(ix) = cosx + isin(x)





1e) What does that mean for the approximation in the equation above?


1g) Why does the end expression imply circulant matrix?
    I also need to derive a formula for F_N^(-1)

* Compare c_k's with classmates
* Using Euler’s identity – Can you use the coefficients to “remove” the second
summand of f2 by just modifying fˆ ∈ C
257
* Can you do the same for the case N = 17, i. e. fˆ ∈ C
17? Try to find a reason for
