Oppgave 1c): dont know how I can explain that the two spaces are equal as well as the dimension of Tn. I know that if theyre the same, dimTn=dimSn
Something to do with linear combination?

cosx = (e^(ix) + e^(-ix))/2 and sinx = (e^(ix)-e^(-ix))/2

e^(ix) = cosx + isin(x)


1d) Why can I just ignore the sum when i am finding a_k and b_k? Look up on why a_0 becomes 0 in second proof.


1e) difference between f(x) := and f(x) =? What does that mean for the approximation in the equation above?

1h) For which cases does **f** approximate $f$ well?
    look at f2 for N = 257 
    Simply code further by computing DFT in transform function


1i) 
* a_k(f2) and b_k(f_2) can be found from the fourier coefficients. We have a_k = 1 for k = 64, b_k = for k = 16.
